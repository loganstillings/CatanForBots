To execute program, either run it in console with `node javascripts/game.js` or run it in chrome browser console by starting up webpack with `webpack --watch` and opening index.html

## Primary To-Dos:
### game.js

  - setupInitialSettlements()
  - checkForVictory()

### player.js
  - buildRoad()
  - buildSettlement()
  - buildCity()
  - stealResource()
  - offerTrade()
  - playDevCardPhase()
  - buyDevCardPhase()
  - buildingPhase()

### rules.js
  - validRoad()
  - validSettlement()
  - validCity()
